•	Developed an innovative image captioning bot utilizing the Flickr8k dataset, an expansive collection of 8,000 distinct images, each paired with five descriptive captions. Leveraging the power of deep learning,
•	Extracted intricate features from these images and harnessed the pre-trained VGG16 model within the Keras framework. To imbue contextual understanding, implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, employing the sequence-to-sequence technique to generate captions that harmoniously resonate with the visuals.
•	Orchestrated the implementation of a BLEU score-based evaluation system, enabling a quantitative assessment of the generated captions' resemblance to human-crafted references, thereby ensuring the continuous enhancement of the captioning proficiency.
